# frese_order_service
### Front end for a bakery
### Ionic Framework for devloping cross-platform application
## My Work
* Worked primarily on the files in "src\app\frese-bakery"
* These files pull from an API to obtain data for items provided<br>
by the bakery.
* The user can add items to a cart, and choose topping and sides.

## How to use
* Must have Node.js and ionic installed
* Run 'ionic serve' to start local application for testing
